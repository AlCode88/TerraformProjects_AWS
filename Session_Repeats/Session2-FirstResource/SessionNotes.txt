Terraform is plugin based architecture.

- .terraform.lock.hcl - will record the providers selections. 

- terraform fmt - will help you to organize your code porperly.

- terraform init - will initialize the plugins

- terraform plan - will help you to see the changes that you will apply.

- /providers.tf is the file where you need to configure the setup.

-  "~>" - Lazy constrain - means the version can be dynamic for example "~> 3.0" it can be 
3.0 and up 3.1, 3.2 and etc. you can hard code the version or if you want to specify something in between
you can use versioning like = ">= 3.0 <4" which means more than 3 and less than 4 

- by defaut yuor credentials are stored ~/.aws/username/credentials file in. 

- We can use the "role" to create a resource. For the "role" it can be any resource that will go and create other
resource on your behalf but for that you need to have a proper role given to your resource and usually it is either EC2 or Lambda
go to the IAM and create a role that you will use to create a resources in our case we just gave an admin role but you can also 
customize it depending on who you are and which environement you work for. Go to IAM press "create a role" choose EC2, and for the policy
you can give an admin access or any custom access.
    After creating a role we need to go back to the instance and attach the role to the instance that has admin role. 

- "know after apply" - resource will be know after apply.

- "terraform apply" -  will create a resources and if you want to auto approve the changes or applies you need to run 
"terraform applu -auto-approve". 

- "required_version" in providers.tf under the terraform will configure the terraform version to be specified and we can do 
the lazy constrain for the version that we want to apply. This is mainly to specify what kind of version of terraform we would
like to use.

- "Yellow ~"  will update resource in place which means it will not going to destroy te resource one of the examples are tags.

- "tfstate" file will keep saves the whole configuration of the existing resources and infrastructure
