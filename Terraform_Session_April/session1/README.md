# What is the Infrastructure as a Code

`* Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure through code instead of through manual processes.
*  Infrastructure as code is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.
* With IaC, configuration files are created that contain your infrastructure specifications, which makes it easier to edit and distribute configurations.
* It ensures that you provision the same environment every time.
`* By codifying and documenting your configuration specifications, IaC aids configuration management and helps you to avoid undocumented, ad-hoc configuration changes.`
