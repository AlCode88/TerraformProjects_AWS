# What is the Infrastructure as a Code

<br>✔️ * Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the **`managing and provisioning of infrastructure through code`** instead of through manual processes.
<br>✔️ *  Infrastructure as code is the `process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files,` rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.
<br>✔️ * With IaC, configuration files are created that `contain your infrastructure specifications,` which makes it easier to edit and distribute configurations.
<br>✔️ * It `ensures that you provision the same environment` every time.
<br>✔️ * By codifying and documenting your configuration specifications, IaC aids configuration management and helps you to avoid undocumented, ad-hoc configuration changes.
