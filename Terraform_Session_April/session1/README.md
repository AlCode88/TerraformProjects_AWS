# What is the Infrastructure as a Code ✅
 * You **`write`** and **`execute`** the code to **`define, deploy, update,`** and **`destroy**` your infrastructure
 * Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the **`managing`** and **`provisioning of infrastructure through code`** instead of through manual processes.
 *  Infrastructure as code is the **`process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files,`** rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.
 * With IaC, configuration files are created that **`contain your infrastructure specifications,`** which makes it easier to edit and distribute configurations.
 * It **`ensures that you provision the same environment`** every time.
 * By codifying and documenting your configuration specifications, IaC aids configuration management and helps you to avoid undocumented, ad-hoc configuration changes.
